    <h2 id="about-title">About This Tool</h2>
    <p id="about-description">
        This tool is designed to help users practice solving the RE2R medallion puzzles in Resident Evil 2 Remake.
        
        It provides an interactive interface to simulate the puzzle-solving experience, with a timer, so you can practice and improve to save time during your runs.

        I have also tried to simulate the input lag between each keypress to better reflect the delay experienced in-game.

        I plan to add sounds and more visual effects in the future to enhance the experience, with the main goal being to maintain performance and responsiveness.

        As I am a beginner runner, I am yet to add the B scenario medallion puzzles, but they will be added as soon as I learn them myself.

    <h2 id="known-bugs-improvements-title">Known Bugs / Improvements to be added</h2>
    <ul id="bugs-list">
        <li>Images don't load properly when first opening the tool / when changing symbols for the first time, so it may look buggy during initial solves
            <ul>
                <li>For now, you'll need to scroll through each symbol, on each section, then the images will load properly when changing symbols.</li>
                <li>I'm working on fixing this as I improve my web-development skills.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Currently no sound when changing symbols or positions.
            <ul>
                <li>Once I am able to clearly record the symbol changing sounds (without background noise), this will be added to the tool</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Aim to add animations when changing symbols to better simulate the in-game experience.
            <ul>
                <li>This will be added as I improve my web-development skills.</li>
            </ul>
